This voice translation tool supports translation, transcription, and audio translation for all languages. It's suitable for the AI era that emphasizes speed. It might not translate the nuances of tone as well as the original, perhaps because current AI still needs a bit more development. Looking at this tool, it seems more suitable for game voice modders, 555+.
üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCurrently, it has the following functions:
1Ô∏è‚É£Voice analysis for gender separation
    ‚úÖWhile transcribing, distinguishes between male and female voices (60-70% accuracy)
2Ô∏è‚É£Transcription with 2 main types, selectable for languages worldwide
   ‚úÖTranscribe with Whisper, with 5 sub-levels of transcription detail (free)
   ‚úÖTranscribe with Google Cloud, requires .json key from Google (paid)
   ‚úÖTranscribe with Gemini, requires writing key in .ini file (supports Multi key) (both free and paid, depending on the Key)
   ‚úÖSupports other APIs, currently no API supported for this transcription part (reserved)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Translation
   ‚úÖCan directly translate using Google (selectable for languages worldwide), or import translated TXT from elsewhere (free)
4Ô∏è‚É£Voice synthesis, can choose the output audio format
   ‚úÖOptions include gTTS (free) and Google Cloud (paid)
   ‚úÖCan add channels as needed (1 channel = 1 voice)
   ‚úÖCurrently only supports Google Cloud (requires .json key)
üìå Channel will be specified in the .txt after transcription as Gender|0|0|, where the third |0| is for specifying the Channel to be used.
üìå üìå In the voice creation section, the free Google voice has only one female voice. No issues found with the length of the generated audio (while Google Cloud seems to have a character limit for audio synthesis, likely around 100 characters).

This tool is complete and ready to use if AI is not used. However, if you want to use AI, you will need additional keys and files, such as:
 1. Google Cloud .json key (you need to sign up for Google Cloud to download the .json key file).
 2. Gemini requires a settings.ini file. Actually, you can use any name; just create a new .txt file and change its extension to .ini, which allows you to enter both free and paid Gemini API Keys.
 3. Voice files: You can copy the names of each voice from https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/list-voices-and-types and paste them into a .txt file. For example:

 Afrikaans (South Africa)	Standard	af-ZA	af-ZA-Standard-A	FEMALE
 
 Arabic	Premium	ar-XA	ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Aoede	FEMALE
 
 Arabic	Premium	ar-XA	ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Charon	MALE
 
 Arabic	Premium	ar-XA	ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Fenrir	MALE
