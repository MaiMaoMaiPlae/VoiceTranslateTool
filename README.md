This tool is complete and ready to use if AI is not used. However, if you want to use AI, you will need additional keys and files, such as:
 1. Google Cloud .json key (you need to sign up for Google Cloud to download the .json key file).
 2. Gemini requires a settings.ini file. Actually, you can use any name; just create a new .txt file and change its extension to .ini, which allows you to enter both free and paid Gemini API Keys.
 3. Voice files: You can copy the names of each voice from https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/list-voices-and-types and paste them into a .txt file. For example:

 Afrikaans (South Africa)	Standard	af-ZA	af-ZA-Standard-A	FEMALE

 Arabic	Premium	ar-XA	ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Aoede	FEMALE

 Arabic	Premium	ar-XA	ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Charon	MALE

 Arabic	Premium	ar-XA	ar-XA-Chirp3-HD-Fenrir	MALE


I'm really having financial difficulties lately, not enough to cover rent and electricity bills.
